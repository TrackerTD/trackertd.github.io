<h3>Shinobi '02</h3>
<br>

<br><br>      
<div class="bodytext">
This game deserves a spot on this list just for Hotsuma's scarf technology, honestly. Shinobi's PS2 reboot is slick, stylish, and extremely satisfying to master. It's easily one of the best games I've played this year.
<br><br>
Hotsuma, this game's titular Shinobi, returns home from a trip to find Japan in ruins and his entire clan murdered by hellspawn. To make things worse, not too long into his journey the curse on his sword gets unsealed, and starts to sap his life away unless he keeps killing - and he's up against his friends, who're now reanimated corpses. As a result, the game is a balancing act of not just killing everything in your path, but doing it as fast as possible to keep the sword's hunger at bay. This is further emphasised by the game's 'TATE' system - if you kill 4 or more enemies in rapid succession, Hotsuma will pull off a stylish finishing move that provides far more souls to keep the sword's hunger sated. It also results in a hefty power boost to the sword, letting you melt through enemies like butter after enough kills. This is especially true of the bosses; every boss will throw mooks at you to keep you back, but if you dispatch them fast enough and take a swing at the boss, you can kill these bosses in a single hit! Actually pulling that off is much easier said than done - the timing is fairly strict - but there is nothing more satisfying than taking out all of the minions during the second boss (a giant spider/tiger hybrid), then jumping up to the big bad and slicing him clean in two. Hotsuma brings in plenty of classic Shinobi weaponry too, such as Shurikens to paralyze enemies, and various Ninjutsu that can turn the tide of battle. 
<br><br> <center><img src="images/Shinobi2.jpg" width=500px></center> <br><br>
There's also a lot of platforming to do, which while somewhat clunky at times, makes the most of Hotsuma's moveset. You can run on walls, and pull off a quick dash that homes in on enemies (and refreshes every time you hit someone). This dash also has 'coyote time', meaning if the dash ends above a pit, you can jump out of it and dash again; small stuff like this really adds to how fun it is to control Hotsuma. You'll need to master the platforming and combat alike though, particularly as Shinobi's stages are completely devoid of checkpoints. While many encounters are mandatory to progress, this does lead to me sometimes weighing up whether speedrunning the stages is the better option, to try and reach the end before the sword can kill Hotsuma. While a very different way to play, it's actually very fun to see how fast you can race through the stages in its own right. Explorers also have something to do, as there's coins hidden throughout each level that will unlock bonus content, including extra characters. You can even unlock Joe Musashi, the original Shinobi - though be warned that the American release increases the amount of coins you need to get these unlockables, which is a bit of a shame. 
<br><br>
Shinobi '02 is a brutally difficult, but incredibly satisfying time from SEGA's early third-party days. The gameplay loop is simply fun, and the presentation is effortlessly sleek (in particular, there's some fantastic music in here). You get into a routine of slicing down foes that feels almost like a macabre dance, and the finishing moves somehow don't wear out their welcome as quick as you'd think. It's probably helped by the fact they look <i>so damn cool</i>. It's also worth noting that the game's final boss is seemingly quite infamous for how damn hard it is, but as long as you keep the TATE system in mind, you'll slice through him eventually. 
<br><br>
It's a shame this one doesn't get as much love as the other titles in the series, as I think it's definitely a highlight. I imagine the severe difficulty puts some people off, which is fair, but I'd highly recommend giving it a shot.

<h3>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk</h3>
<br>
<br>

<br><br>      
<div class="bodytext">
I absolutely love Jet Set Radio. It's probably my favourite Dreamcast game that doesn't involve a blue hedgehog, and artistically remains a huge inspiration to me. I once spent an entire week doing absolutely nothing but playing it to 100% completion. I really wanted that playable dog on rollerskates.
<br><br>
So I was cautiously optimistic when Bomb Rush Cyberfunk was first announced. I say cautiously because while it certainly looked the part, complete with Hideki Naganuma bringing some glorious trailer music, I'd been here before. Hover: Revolt of Gamers was once mooted as the spiritual successor to JSR, and then it released. It was not. Thankfully, BRC sticks the landing far, far better - almost a little too well, as if there's one point of contention with this game, it's that it's maybe a little <i>too</i> blatantly Jet Set Radio. Either way, it certainly gave me what I wanted; Bomb Rush blew my expectations out of the water, with a gorgeous world full of things to do tricks off of, stellar character designs, and of course a bloody fantastic soundtrack curated from a wide range of artists. In Bomb Rush, your aim is to go 'All City' - essentially, to control all of the turf in the town by becoming the dominant gang. I was happy enough with this setup, but soon enough it turns out things are a lot more messed up than a mere gang war, and I was genuinely surprised by how much further the story went than settling for just a blatant JSR copy. 
<br><br>
Bomb Rush is a joy to move around in. The controls feel supremely fine-tuned, and it always felt like a dropped combo was my fault; at least compared to Jet Set Radio, a game I adore but can also admit has some slightly archaic controls. Pulling off tricks is fairly simple, but keeping those combos going becomes a matter of covering as much distance as you can, and looking good doing it, for as long as possible. JSR-style infinite combos see diminishing returns here, as the game rewards you for seeking out new rails to grind, new walls to ride, and even spots to tag with the wide array of graffiti on offer.
