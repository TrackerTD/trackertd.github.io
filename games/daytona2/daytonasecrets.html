    <h2>DAYTONA USA 2'S MANY SECRETS</h2>
    <hr>
</div>
<center>
<h4><font color=white size=7>EXTRA SELECT SCREEN OPTIONS</h4><hr></font>
There's a few hidden options you can enable in the the Course/Car Select screens - some that the game tells you about, and some that it doesn't.
</center>
<div class=textbox><HR>
  <div class=innerheader><center><b><font size=5>Mirror Mode</font></b></center></div><hr>
<br>
<img src="images/mirrorcheat.png" width=400px title="Mirroring this track can't hide how sauceless it is.">
<br>
<b>Hold Start when selecting a course.</b><br> You'll instead select a Mirrored version of it. There's not really much of a way to tell you've done this right until the stage loads.
<br><HR>
<div class=innerheader><center><b><font size=5>Reverse Mode</font></b></center></div><hr>
<br>
<img src="images/reverse2.png" width=400px title="I like it when games let me drive in reverse."><img src="images/reverse1.png" width=400px title="It's fun to get a new perspective on the track. Like that giant penguin tunnel.">
<br>
<b>POWER EDITION ONLY!</b>
<br>
<b>Hold Brake when selecting a course</b>.<br>
<left>'Reverse' will show up at the bottom of the screen to let you know you've done it.</left>
<br><br>
<img src="images/reversebote.png" width=400px title="This exact thing works in Ridge Racer too!">
<br>
There is a way to drive the course backwards in Battle on the Edge though... <b>turn around <i>when the race starts!</i></b> <div class=bodytext>Your pit crew will beg you to turn around, but eventually the big 'Reverse' banner will move to the bottom of the screen, and in
the Japanese version you'll hear someone (that I'm presuming is Takenobu Mitsuyoshi) yell something, signifying you're now running the race in reverse. Obviously, there's one very big difference between this and Power Edition's more 'legitimate' implementation though -
you're driving into oncoming traffic!</div>
<br>
<img src="images/reversebote2.png" width=400px title="You lose!"><img src="images/reversebote3.png" width=400px title="This might look like Victory Lane, but it's actually Pity Lane. You made it.">
<br>
<div class=bodytext>That said, if you're able to do this and actually finish the race, you're treated to a unique sight; the ending credits for the stage, despite the fact you technically finished last!</div>
<hr>
<div class=innerheader><center><b><font size=5>Time Attack</font></b></center></div><hr>
<br>
<img src="images/timelap2.png" width=400px title="Can you beat my time?"><img src="images/timelap1.png" width=400px title="That was a rhetorical question. Of course you can.">
<br><b>Hold Start when selecting a transmission to enable Time Attack mode.</b><br>OK, this one isn't really hidden; the game literally tells you about it. But we might as well be thorough...
<br><hr>
<div class=innerheader><center><b><font size=5>Vocalist Toggle</font></b></center></div><hr>
<br>
<img src="images/gentlemen.png" width=400px title="Between you and me, this is the one and only time I'd actually recommend *not* choosing Mitsuyoshi.">
<br>
<b>Hold Start during the "Gentlemen, Start Your Engines" screen.</b><div class=bodytext>This toggles the vocalist opposite to the game's current default settings. The US region default is Dennis St James, while the JP default is Takenobu Mitsuyoshi.
This code's notable as with the US board region, it's actually the <i>only</i> way to hear Mitsuyoshi's vocals - you can't change the vocalist setting in the Test Menu outside of Japan!
<br><br>
Apparently this was also supposed to change the announcer clip used when selecting the Challenge/Mix course in Power Edition too - in the Japanese version, you'll always hear Mitsuyoshi shout 'MIX!' when selecting it, and in the US version you'll always
hear Dennis St James say "Challenge"; <a href =https://tcrf.net/Daytona_USA_2:_Power_Edition#Unused_Sounds><font color="lime">but opposite voice clips exist for both versions!</font></a>
</div>
<hr>
<div class=innerheader><center><b><font size=5>Song Select</font></b></center></div><hr>
<br>
<b>POWER EDITION ONLY!</b>
<br>
<b>Hold one of the VR Buttons during the "Gentlemen, Start Your Engines" screen.</b><br>
<div class=bodytext>If you just can't get enough of the Beginner Course song (like me), why not just listen to it on every course? Each VR Button corresponds to a different song. The order's pretty obvious, but it's as follows:</div>

<b>VR1</b> - Slingshot :: <b>VR2</b> - I Can Do It :: <b>VR3</b> - Skyscraper Sequence :: <b>VR4</b> - Ending Medley
<br><br>
<div class=bodytext>That last one's a bit odd - it literally just plays through the different 'Victory Lane' themes, and then once the last one ends, it's... just over. Could've popped an unused track in here, SEGA...</div>
<hr>
<div class=innerheader><center><b><font size=5>Hornet Special... in Battle on the Edge</font></b></center></div><hr>
<br>
<img src="images/hornetbote1.png" width=400px title="You can use the secret car!">
<img src="images/hornetbote2.png" width=400px title="It was funny seeing this car's reputation go from 'literally doesn't work' to 'this is the best thing ever.'">
<br>
<b>BATTLE ON THE EDGE ONLY!</b>
<br><b>Before starting the game, put the stick into Gear 1. At the Course Select, move into Gear 4. Before selecting a course, input the following VR Buttons: 1, 4, 2, 4, 1, 2, 2+3 (together), 1.</b> <br>You'll now have access to one of the best-kept secrets in all of gaming - the Hornet Special!</b>
<br>
<div class=bodytext>The Hornet Special has one major difference over every other car - you can customise its stats on the Car Select screen! Using the VR buttons and steering wheel, you can change the Engine, Steering and Suspension to better suit your playstyle, or just make an absolute monster of a car. For years it was assumed that this
car was an unfinished leftover of some kind, because people could only figure out how to access it via hacking - which bypassed the customisation aspect, and basically broke its stats, making it nigh impossible to actually use. It's speculated that the only people who actually
knew about the code to unlock the Hornet Special were superplay group Team Marubaku (MBK), who referred to it in their SuperPlay videos for the game but didn't share the code. In the end, over <i>20 years later</i>, It was
<a href=https://tcrf.net/Daytona_USA_2:_Battle_on_the_Edge><font color="lime">The Cutting Room Floor</a></font> who finally datamined the solution. Even the official Daytona 2 guidebooks don't mention this car!</div>

<h4><font color=white size=7>RACE SECRETS</h4><hr></font>
Next up - fun stuff you can try mid-race!
<div class=textbox>
<HR>
  <div class=innerheader><center><b><font size=5>Extra Views</font></b></center></div><hr>
  <br>
  <img src="images/secretcam1.png" width=400px title="I may not be able to see half of the screen, but at least it looks cool."><img src="images/secretcam2.png" width=400px title="I may not be able to see literally anything in front of me, but at least it looks... like, alright, I guess.">
  <br>
  <b>Hold VR4, then press the other 3 VR buttons for a birds-eye view. Press VR1+VR2 for a left wheel-cam, and VR2+VR3 for a right wheel-cam. Press VR2 twice for a cockpit cam.</b><br>
  This is actually a carry-over from the original Daytona USA. It's fairly impractical, but still kinda neat!
  <br><hr>

  <div class=innerheader><center><b><font size=5>Start Button Secrets</font></b></center></div><hr>
  <br>

  Alright, this is where stuff gets <i>weird.</i> Every track in Daytona USA 2 has a secret that can be accessed by pressing Start at some point in the course. Let's go through them.
  <br><br>
<center><b><font size=5>Beginner Course - Start Line Messages</font></b></center>

  <img src="images/go.png" width=300px title="GO"><img src="images/to.png" width=300px title="TO"><img src="images/hell.png" width=300px title="HELL">
  <br>
  <b>Press Start at the Start/Finish Line of the Beginner Course.</b><br>
  <div class=bodytext>The LED sign will cycle through various messages as you tap the Start Button. Some are fairly standard, such as 'ERROR' and 'SEGA'. Others sound like taglines, ('REAL HOT RACER!') and some are just straight up <i>rude</i>, as you can see above.</div>
  <br>
<center><b><font size=5>Advanced Course - Laser Beams</font></b></center>

  <img src="images/lasers1.png" width=400px title="Please enjoy my wonderful photography."><img src="images/lasers2.png" width=400px title="If you squint you can make out like, two whole laser beams here.">
  <br>
  <b>Press Start during the Space Haneda sequence on Lap 3 or later.</b>
  <div class=bodytext>You see all those spaceships flying around in the sky? Well now you can <i>control them!</i> Or at least, their weaponry; tapping Start makes them fire their lasers. Which doesn't really do much besides covering the track with explosions.</div>
  <br>
<center><b><font size=5>Expert Course - Spinning Fans</font></b></center>

<img src="images/fans1.png" width=400px title="Gaze upon these spinning fans, as captured in a still image that can't convey that they're spinning.">
<br>
<b>Hold Start during the harbor area of the course.</b>
<div class=bodytext>Holding Start during this part of the track will cause the fans here to spin. That's pretty fun. Peak of excitement, innit.</div>
<div class=bodytext>Anyway, this is the part where I get a bit of an ego, because there's actually a second part to this particular Start Button secret - that would've gone completely undiscovered, where it not for the fact I was <i>really bored one day.</i> For some reason, I pondered
how fast those fans could spin - and I figured the best way to test this out was to <b>hold Start for an entire lap</b>, then come back to the harbor area.</div>

So, I did exactly that, got back to the harbor to watch how fast those fans were spinning, and-
<br><br>
<img src="images/fans2.png" width=400px title="OH GOD">
<br><br>
<font size=5>HUH!?</font>
<br><br>
<img src="images/fans3.png" width=400px title="And off they go.">
<br>
<div class=bodytext>Yes, if you hold the Start Button for an entire lap, the fans will literally <i>fly off their hinges</i>, shoot off into the sky, and eventually disappear behind a hill in the distance. When I first saw this, I was absolutely dumbfounded that they actually thought to program
something so... specific. But then again, that's 90's SEGA for you. This will always be the bizarre Daytona USA 2 thing <i>I</i> discovered, so it'll always be sort of special to me, as ridiculous as that sounds.
Incidentally, if you'd rather see these in action - because these screenshots are all native res and can be somewhat hard to make out - <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=er0q_Kr5i94&><font color="lime">I uploaded a video of all three of these secrets a while ago.</a></font></div>
  <hr>
  <div class=innerheader><center><b><font size=5>Traffic Cam Zoom</font></b></center></div><hr>
  <br>
  <img src="images/traffic1.png" width=400px title="Now I can see the guy crashing into me even later!"><img src="images/traffic2.png" width=400px title="Now I can see the guy crashing into me like, 3 years in advance!">
  <br>
  <b>Hold Start during the race, then press the VR Buttons.</b>
  <div class=bodytext>Another holdover from the original Daytona USA. You can use this to change how zoomed in the traffic camera on the HUD is. Maybe you'll find this helpful!</div>
</div>
<center>
<hr>
<h4><font color=white size=7>TEST MENU STUFF</h4><hr></font>
Things you can find buried in the game's Operator Test Menu.

  <div class=textbox>
    <HR>
    <div class=innerheader><center><b><font size=5>Region Change</font></b></center></div><hr>
    <br>
    <img src="images/regionchange.png" width=400px title="I should probably check the non-JP/US regions for differences at some point...">
    <br>
    <b>Enter the Test Menu. Hold Start and press VR4, VR4, VR2, VR3, VR1, VR3, VR2. <br>Alternatively, enter the Test Menu and press Service and Test at the same time.</b><br>
    <div class=bodytext>This lets you change the region of your Daytona 2 board. This is actually pretty handy, as there's some differences between the two beyond just the language; although nothing especially substantial.</div>
    <hr>
    <div class=innerheader><center><b><font size=5>Campaign Mode</font></b></center></div><hr>
    <br>
    <img src="images/campaign1.png" width=400px title="I don't have a witty comment for this image.">    <img src="images/campaign2.png" width=400px title="Hey, that's us!">
    <br>
    <b>Under Game Assignments in the Test Menu, change the Ranking Mode to Campaign.</b>
    <div class=bodytext>This isn't so much a secret, more a really cool option I never saw anyone talk about. Daytona USA 2 has options for 'Campaign Ranking', that basically allows arcade operators to host tournaments and competitions within the game.</div>
    <img src="images/campaign3.png" width=400px title="Well, now you know when to buy me gifts and stuff.">    <img src="images/campaign4.png" width=400px title="Seeing off some fierce competition here.">
    <br>
    The game will keep track of your points (as long as you use the same name and date of birth each time you play), and arcade operators can even enter their arcade's name in the menu settings, to be displayed ingame! I dig it when games do this.
    <br>
</div>
<hr>
<h4><font color=white size=7>LIVE MODE</h4><hr></font>

  <div class=textbox>
While not as rare a sight nowadays, the game's Live Mode used to be a bit of an enigma. With Model 3 Network emulation being a thing now, it's a lot easier to check out at home.
<br>
<img src="images/live1.png" width=300px title="The decal doesn't look any prettier from this angle."><img src="images/live2.png" width=300px title="Oh, Astro Waterfall Speedway. You were too good for this world."><img src="images/live3.png" width=300px title="Hey look, it's Manchester Picadilly!">
<br>
<div class=bodytext>When one cabinet in a networked set is put into 'Live' mode in the test menu, it becomes a camera feed into the other games being played. This isn't really anything that mind-blowing, but it's cool how in-depth this is; every track has a bunch of named
landmarks to help give them some more identity (with some of these names, such as the Advanced Course's Black Hole Turn, being fairly well-known in the community), and in longer races the commentator will even hold interviews with the pit crew and other drivers
- they recorded a lot of dialogue for this! Certainly, it's cool to experience.</div>
<br>Originally, this page was going to catalogue every single one of these landmarks... maybe another time.
